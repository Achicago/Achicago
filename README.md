**Full-Stack Engineer | Cloud & DevOps | Fintech/Blockchain Builder | AI-Driven Product Development**

## About Me

I build products from the ground up.
Most of my work sits at the intersection of **fintech**, **crypto infrastructure**, and **scalable web platforms**.
I’ve spent the last few years designing systems, leading engineering execution, and shipping software in environments where timing and reliability actually matter.

Right now, I’m leading development on **Sendcoins**, a crypto-based remittance platform, while also building additional systems around payments, licensing infrastructure, and platform scalability.
